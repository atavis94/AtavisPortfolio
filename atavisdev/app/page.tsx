        Hi, I'm Aiden, and I love to build things on the intertubes.
        <br />
        My passion is anything React, NextJs, and TailwindCSS. I'm also great with anything .NET related.
        <br />
        I crave knowledge and want to better myself as a developer.
        <br />
        I make a great member of any team. I'm a solid team player and I focus on the big picture of getting the job done.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here's a little bit about me...
